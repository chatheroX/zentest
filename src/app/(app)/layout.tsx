          For simplicity, AppHeader is used and will show "Dashboard" and "Logout"
          if we pass isAuthenticated=true and userRole.
          However, since we are defining specific dashboard layouts (student/teacher),
          they will handle their own structure including sidebars.
          This (app)/layout.tsx can remain minimal or be used for truly shared elements
          above the student/teacher specific layouts.
